# landing-page
Completd the Landing Page over the course of 2 days.

A lot of trial and error / guessing was involved. Never made use of 'flex' (grow/shrink/basis), nor flex-wrap. The latter I can never get to work properly. I wrote a lot of useless code that ended up doing nothing at all. I also screwed up the height of my Flexboxes, by using padding, which made a mess towards the end of the project. My CSS could probably be a lot cleaner. I only made use of type and class selectors. No descendant combinator, no chaining, no ID selector.

I can only hope I have a better understanding of Flexbox in the future.

Up next: **JavaScript.**
